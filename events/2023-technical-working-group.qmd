## Friday, December 1

### Matching Scientists and Inventors
**Speakers:** Lee Owen Fleming (UC Berkeley), Matt Marx (Cornell/NBER), Emma Scharfmann (UC Berkeley)

The presenters examined how scientific researchers and patent inventors overlap. Key findings included discussion of "gatekeepers" or "scientist-inventors"—individuals who both publish and patent.

**Discussion Points:**
- OpenAlex data showed a chemistry paper bump around 2010 due to online publication dating rather than invention timing
- Geographic patterns suggested these aren't necessarily information gatekeepers
- East Asian countries may have cultural factors regarding graduate student employment pathways
- Most research output involves people conducting both activities rather than discrete pairs
- "Gatekeepers" tend to be prolific scientists with 50+ papers
- University patenting research confirms patent-active professors are highly productive overall
- Clustering methodology based on patent/paper pairs expanded via ORCID data
- Accuracy validation remained incomplete after clustering

### The Commercial Potential of Science & Its Realization
**Speakers:** Sharique Hasan (Duke), Roger Masclans Armengol (Duke), Wesley M. Cohen (Duke/NBER)

This presentation explored using machine learning to measure commercial potential by predicting patent citations from research abstracts.

**Methodology:**
- Used SciBERT embeddings for scientific abstracts
- Developed neural network predictions with rolling annual models
- Achieved 0.74 AUROC and accuracy scores
- Validated against technology transfer office disclosure data (96k publications, 13k matched to 2,700 inventions)
- Models identified specific article language predicting patent use independent of h-index

**Key Findings:**
- Model picked up on problem scope (big vs. narrow), potential population impact
- Commercial product/service references improved predictions
- Theory versus applied physics showed clear distinction
- About 60% of institutional variation in patent citations explained by ex-ante commercial potential
- Nobel Prize research papers tested favorably in predictions

**Limitations Noted:**
- Many innovations reach market without patents
- Long time horizons required before commercialization
- Indirect paths to commercialization may be missed

**Discussion Points:**
- Public university funding constraints may limit realized potential despite high ex-ante potential
- "Realization gap" represents undiscovered high-potential research
- Comparing to human evaluator performance (AUC threshold for practical utility)
- Subfield modeling showed improvements; physics/quantum distinction particularly clear
- ChatGPT abstraction "patentification" had minimal effect (2-3%) on model
- Path-breaking innovations with long gestation periods pose measurement challenges
- Possible capture of field-trajectory indicators rather than pure commercial potential
- Data will be made public

### New Facts and Data about Professors and their Research
**Speakers:** Kyle R. Myers (Harvard), Wei Yang Tham (Harvard)

Researchers analyzed 260k academics using survey data to examine earnings, productivity, and research patterns.

**Key Findings:**
1. Within-field earnings variation exceeds across-field variation
2. Institutions, ranks, tasks, and funding sources significantly impact earnings
3. Standard research output metrics poorly predict earnings
4. Publications-per-year is mediocre proxy for publications-per-research-hour
5. Research risk factors include fundraising and theory generation
6. Life-cycle changes observed in inputs/outputs but not audiences
7. "Edisons" (applied researchers) take more personal risks and earn more than "Bohrs" (theoretical researchers)

**Context:** Databases designed for scientific advancement require assumptions to evaluate science, lacking traditional price signals for inputs/outputs.

## Saturday, December 2

### Index and Validation Datasets
**Speaker:** Agnes Cameron (Knowledge Futures)

The Innovation Information Initiative's open innovation data index (iiindex.org) turned two years old. The presentation focused on validation datasets as research infrastructure tools.

**Current State:**
- Index accessible at iiindex.org
- GitHub repository for direct edits and contributions
- Many papers publish data but withhold validation datasets

**Infrastructure Models:**
- Machine learning communities (HuggingFace, Kaggle, Papers with Code) demonstrate robust dataset-sharing practices
- HuggingFace shows task usage and model deployment
- Hugging Face approach provides infrastructure precedent

**Gaps Identified:**
- Projects using validation data rarely publish those datasets
- Credit attribution for validation dataset creation unclear
- Norm around sharing and reuse needs development

**Discussion Points:**
- Limited data on validation dataset reuse versus original datasets
- Credit norms differ between CS and other fields
- Dataset papers alongside datasets help (NBER precedent)
- Adaptation to field-specific norms necessary

- Added non-patenting R&D firms
- Transitioned from ORBIS to SEC filings
- Migrated from PATSTAT to PatentsView
- Included patent-level reassignments and pre-grant applications
- Moved from Web of Science to OpenAlex

**Technical Improvements:**
- Enhanced matching algorithms
- Raw affiliation string processing (81 million unique strings from PDFs)
- LLM-based name cleaning and entity resolution
- LLAMA and vLLM deployed for cleanup
- Cascade of cleaning steps for OpenAlex matching

**Discussion Points:**
- OpenAlex could potentially handle affiliation normalization internally
- Ownership change tracking, name changes, and renewal patterns under examination
- Patent sales tracking extends to available data
- LLM validity checking needed (data quality dependent)
- Pre-grant publication assignment completeness uncertain
- European patent pair data potentially available
- USPTO requires assignment reporting but lacks enforceability for non-reporting
- Industry standard: mandatory reporting should be required for enforceability

### Improving Patent Assignee-Firm Bridge with Web Search Results
**Speakers:** Yuheng Ding (World Bank), Karam Jo (Korea Development Institute), Seula Kim (Princeton)

Researchers constructed longitudinal patent-assignee-firm bridges using Census administrative data and web search.

**Methodology:**
- Linked USPTO to Business Register and Longitudinal Business Database
- Name standardization and fuzzy-matching
- Web-search-aided patent-firm crosswalk
- Extraction from internet searches

**Results:**
- Search-aided matching accounts for 4-8.5% of total matches
- Provides stable bridge over longer horizons
- Helps study non-public firms absent from PTO data

**Example Application:** Chinese competition impact on firm innovation

**Discussion Points:**
- Fuzzy matching fixes minor character variations; "IBM Corp" to "International Business Machines" requires different approaches
- Private firms represent approximately 30% of population
- Internet search effectiveness varies temporally (more recent data advantages)
- Time-variation accuracy changes under investigation
- Public-access scaled-down version under consideration
- Small firm name standardization within patent data valuable
- Potential integration with PatentsView public data recommended
- Census-internal bridges under coordination with Nathan's 2000+ work
- Multiple linkage methodologies exist (DISCERN, PTO, NETS/D&B)
- Comparison across dataset variants needed to assess agreement levels
- Patent application terminology clarification: granted patents versus pending/abandoned applications
- Lawyer-based firm confirmation via consistent legal representation useful

### The Government Patent Register: A New Lens on Historical U.S. Government-Funded Patenting
**Speakers:** Daniel P. Gross (Duke/NBER), Bhaven N. Sampat (Arizona State/NBER)

Historical analysis of government patent funding through register digitization.

**Background:**
- World War II marked first major government funding shock
- Multiple funding agencies emerged (PHS, DoD, AEC, NSF)
- Bayh-Dole Act (1981) established uniform licensing and required interest statements
- Researchers scanned and digitized government patent register through mid-1990s

**Key Findings:**
- Government patent share peaked during WWII, predominantly DoD-funded
- Post-WWII decline observed
- Example: Fermi patents in register

**Data Integration Plans:**
- Link Register with Fleming et al. dataset
- Incorporate Matt and Lee's work
- Create modern register combining sources
- Analyze patent language patterns across regimes

**Research Applications:**
- Historical indicator of public versus private R&D
- Control variables for policy evaluations
- Exploitation of Bayh-Dole pre/post variation
- "Title" versus "license" policy comparison

**Discussion Points:**
- Government funding role in major paradigm shifts (COVID vaccines, iPhone)
- Citation analysis of government-funded patents compared to private
- Register stitching availability imminent (sharing underway)
- Connection to institutional creation (Stanford Engineering) under investigation
- Pre-WWII data backfilling by agencies documented
- Total pre-WWII patent counts modest; record-keeping reliability uncertain
- Agency backfilling variance identification needed
- Compliance with reporting requirements under-explored
- Scientific publication citations to patents studied (Fleming dataset available for 1970+)

### Startup Patenting
**Speakers:** Michael Ewens (Columbia/NBER), Matt Marx (Cornell/NBER)

Researchers developed methods to match startups with patent data using publicly available sources.

**Data Challenges:**
- PatEx small/micro firm indicator doesn't proxy for age
- Crunchbase-2013 lacks founding year for most firms
- DISCERN only provides public listing dates
- Traditional Census data access limited

**Solutions Implemented:**
- OpenCorporates (B-corp sustainability model: free searches with paid harvesting)
- Loose API searching with exact matching for short/common names
- Filtering for dissolution timing and incorporation dates

**Current Status (Foundingpatents.com - Beta):**
- 142,000 assignees located
- 85% of patents, 73% of assignees covered
- 135k from OpenCorporates, 2k from DISCERN 1.0, 4k from PitchBook
- Founding year and confidence scores included
- VC funding flags with confidence scores

**Findings:**
- Young firms receive more citations across broader patent classes
- Young versus small (not young) distinction: fewer science citations
- Selection bias: all old firms were formerly young
- Firms stopping patenting after 3-8 years show early novelty peaks
- Young firms correlate with new industry formation
- VC-backed firms represent one-third of total
- No novelty difference between VC and non-VC funding
- VC-backed firms cite science and receive citations less frequently

**"Burden of Knowledge" Investigation:**
- Innovation difficulty increasing? (longer PhDs, expanded knowledge requirements)
- First patent assignment arriving earlier in firm age
- Hiring of older inventors with patent experience increasing
- Multi-class prior patent experience rising

**Next Steps:**
- International assignee inclusion
- Integration with updated patent-paper pair dataset (moved to OpenAlex)
- Launch relianceonscience.org (updated through 2022)

**Discussion Points:**
- Good idea versus funding causality unclear (both directions possible)
- Dataset anomalies present (negative patent years in historical data)
- Historical assignee matching particularly difficult
- Startup Cartography comparison (also uses OpenCorporates)
- Declining time-to-first-patent with increasing inventor age suggests delayed founding with rapid patenting post-launch
- Founder source analysis (academia versus industry) possible
- Graham/Samuelson survey (2008) warns: startup assignees miss founder-held patents
- Multi-source matching concerns: Crunchbase, Capital IQ, PitchBook show <20% overlap
- NETS linkage achieves 80% match rate
- Source dependence caution warranted
