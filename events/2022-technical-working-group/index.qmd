### Building a Corpus of Patent-Article Siblings
**Speakers:** Jean-Marc Deltorn, Dominique Guellec, Jiangyin Liu, Chenyin Wu

Creating matched pairs of scientific papers and patents using text embeddings and machine learning classifiers.

**Key Goal:** Develop a public corpus mapping relationships between patents and academic publications

**Methodology:**
- Text embeddings for semantic similarity
- Machine learning classifiers for matching
- Focus on patent-article sibling relationships

---

### 5:20 PM – Patents Phrase to Phrase Semantic Matching Dataset
**Speakers:** Grigor Aslanyan, Ian Wetherbee (Google)

Introduction of the Google Patent Phrase Similarity Dataset.

**Features:**
- Human-rated semantic similarity scores for technical terms
- Contextual CPC (Cooperative Patent Classification) classifications
- Supported a Kaggle competition in March 2022
- Public dataset for innovation research

### Mapping Patents to Technology Standards
**Speakers:** Fabian Gaessler, Dietmar Harhoff, Lorenz Brachtendorf

Dataset linking patents to technology standards from major standard-setting organizations.

**Dataset Details:**
- Available on Harvard Dataverse
- Includes 60,000+ documents
- Links ETSI, IEEE, and ITU-T standards to patents
- Addresses Standard Essential Patents (SEP) litigation analysis

**Applications:**
- Strategic patent analysis
- Technology standard evolution tracking
- SEP litigation research
- Innovation policy analysis

### 9:40 AM – NBER Orange Book Dataset: A User's Guide
**Speakers:** Maya Durvasula, Scott Hemphill, Lisa Larrimore Ouellette, Bhaven Sampat, Heidi Williams

Newly digitized Orange Book records mapping pharmaceutical patents to drug approvals.

**Dataset Coverage:**
- Period: 1985-2016
- Four data files covering:
  - Drug patents
  - Patent exclusivity periods
  - Drug approval data
  - Patent maintenance information

**Availability:** NBER website

**Applications:**
- Pharmaceutical innovation research
- Drug pricing analysis
- Patent strategy in healthcare
- Regulatory policy evaluation

---

### 10:35 AM – Progress Report on Inventor-Author Crosswalk
**Speaker:** Lee Fleming (UC Berkeley)

Linking inventor and author identities across patent and publication databases using machine learning models.

**Technical Approach:**
- Machine learning models for entity disambiguation
- Cross-database identity matching
- Integration with OpenAlex and PatentsView

**Challenges:**
- Managing OpenAlex database updates
- PatentsView annual releases requiring ~10,000 compute operations
- Computational intensity of large-scale matching
- Maintaining accuracy across database versions

**Goals:**
- Enable research on scientist-inventor transitions
- Track knowledge flows between academia and patenting
- Support innovation ecosystem analysis

---

### 11:30 AM – Panel: Validating Patent Metrics from Semantic Analysis
**Moderator:** Bronwyn Hall (Stanford/NBER)

**Panelists:** Sam Arts, Dokyun Lee, Ina Ganguli, Josh Lerner

Discussion of validation frameworks for innovation metrics derived from semantic analysis.

**Key Themes:**
- Establishing validation frameworks
- Comparing semantic measures to traditional citation-based metrics
- Expert ratings versus outcome indicators
- Reliability and reproducibility in patent analytics
- Ground truth establishment for semantic metrics

**Discussion Points:**
- How to validate new semantic approaches
- Relationship between text-based and citation-based measures
- Expert judgment in metric validation
- Applications in technology assessment
- Future directions for semantic patent analysis

---

### 1:00 PM – Lunch

---

## Key Themes

The 2022 Technical Working Group meeting focused on several interconnected themes:

- **Dataset Development:** Creating comprehensive datasets linking patents to external knowledge sources (articles, standards, drugs)
- **Semantic Similarity:** Applying modern NLP and embedding approaches to patent analysis
- **Validation Frameworks:** Establishing rigorous methods for validating innovation metrics
- **Entity Disambiguation:** Matching inventor and author identities across databases
- **Domain Applications:** Specialized datasets for pharmaceuticals, technology standards, and academic-industry linkages
