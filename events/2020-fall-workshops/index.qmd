**October - December 2020** | Virtual (Zoom)

**Format:** Five-part workshop series, Wednesdays 12:00-1:00 PM or 12:00-1:30 PM EDT

## Overview

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Innovation Information Initiative replaced the traditional December in-person Technical Working Group meeting with a series of five virtual workshops. These sessions fostered dialogue among researchers exploring various dimensions of innovation metric construction.

Each session featured 20-minute presentations by panelists followed by discussion periods. Recordings and detailed notes are available for individual sessions.

## Workshop Sessions

### Session 1: Linguistics
**Date:** October 28, 2020

**Panelists:**
- Nancy Kong
- Jonathan Ashtor
- Ryan Whalen

**Focus:** Linguistic approaches to patent text analysis, natural language processing techniques for innovation metrics, and text-based patent classification methods.

---

### Session 2: Citation
**Date:** November 4, 2020

**Panelists:**
- Matt Marx (Cornell/NBER)
- Cyril Verluise
- Osmat Jefferson

**Focus:** Citation network analysis, patent-paper linkages, forward and backward citation patterns, and citation-based innovation metrics.

**Topics Covered:**
- Citation data quality and completeness
- Cross-database citation matching
- Science-technology knowledge flows
- Citation-based impact measures

---

### Session 3: Geography
**Date:** November 11, 2020

**Panelists:**
- Antonin Bergaud
- Gabriele Cristelli

**Focus:** Geographic disambiguation and location assignment for inventors, assignees, and institutions.

**Key Challenges:**
- Address standardization and geocoding
- Inventor mobility tracking
- Regional innovation systems analysis
- Cross-border collaboration patterns

---

### Session 4: Gender
**Date:** November 18, 2020

**Panelists:**
- Çağatay Bircan
- Alenka Guzmán

**Focus:** Gender identification methodologies, diversity in innovation, and gender-based analysis of patenting and publishing.

**Discussion Topics:**
- Name-based gender inference methods
- Accuracy and validation approaches
- International naming conventions
- Gender disparities in innovation
- Non-binary considerations in classification

---

### Session 5: History
**Date:** December 2, 2020

**Panelists:**
- Mike Andrews
- Dan Gross (Duke/NBER)
- Tania Babina (Columbia)

**Focus:** Historical innovation data collection, digitization of historical records, and long-run innovation trends.

**Topics:**
- Historical patent data digitization
- Archive access and data quality
- Temporal consistency in metrics
- Long-run innovation patterns
- Connecting historical and modern datasets

---

## Key Themes

The 2020 Fall Workshops explored fundamental challenges in innovation measurement:

- **Data Quality:** Ensuring accuracy and consistency across datasets
- **Methodology:** Developing rigorous approaches to metric construction
- **Standardization:** Creating shared definitions and best practices
- **Validation:** Testing and verifying measurement approaches
- **Cross-cutting Issues:** Addressing challenges that span multiple dimensions (e.g., geographic-gender interactions)

---

## Format Innovation

The virtual workshop series format proved effective for:
- Focused, topic-specific discussions
- Broader participation across geographies
- More frequent community engagement
- Accessible recordings for wider audience
- Lower barriers to participation

This model influenced future I³ event planning and community engagement strategies.
