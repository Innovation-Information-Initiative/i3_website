## **Building a Corpus of "Patent-Article Siblings"**

*Jean-Marc Deltorn*, University of Strasbourg\
Dominique Guellec, Observatoire des Sciences et Techniques\
Jiangyin Liu, Observatoire des Sciences et Techniques\
Chenyin Wu, University of Strasbourg

Scientific papers can serve as a background approximation to the field
in which the patent exists. Trying to use citations for this has
limitations. So does language similarity: Language serves different
purposes in the scientific and patent worlds. Standards of clarity are
different.

Keywords are brittle: latent semantic analysis is not currently capable
of going beyond the style to the underlying technical object. We are
looking at embeddings, and want to evaluate whether text embeddings can
discriminate true patent-paper pairs from non-pairs.

We started with a manual ground-truth corpus. Chose a subset of domains
and their CPC codes. Then evaluated different embeddings: GANs,
transformers, and other models, and developed a classifier based on
them. \
Selection of corresponding articles: based on inventor last names, pub
date, and priority date. Then querying the resulting corpus, looking at
Jaccard index, date difference, and text embedding difference (of
abstracts)...

Ongoing work: \
- extend to other technical fields (ML, crypto, quantum computing,
ARNm)\
- build a **public corpus** of field-dependent PPPs\
Future work:\
- extend to other sources (preprints, other media)\
- fine tune language models\
- address limitations: reliance on author/inventor names

#### **Questions + Comments**:

-    Q: Timeframe? A: We want to extend this to a much larger set...

-   Q: How do you ensure patent/paper have an overlapping author? \
    A: we query Semantic Scholar, to maximize proximity of patent +
    author

-   Q: my understanding is that there are differences normatively and
    legally re: what counts in being an author / inventor. How do you
    think about that?\
    A: the rules are different, though it's a similar principle in
    Europe and the US

-    Comment: great to see this, fantastic use of patent data. As you
    expand on this project: institutional affiliation could help
    evaluate some matches. And have you considered looking at full
    claims, not just abstracts? \
    A: yes, affiliation is interesting. \
    Our experience from a first test was that the full claim tree did
    not add much value in classifying true matches, and takes a lot of
    computation time. (LeeF: seconded)

    -   Comment: Affiliations are missing for 20% of OpenAlex. When
        there are multiple authors + institutions, they don't always
        link correctly.

    -   From the other side, patents from universities can be assigned
        to someone else (a grant provider, a startup) leading to other
        notable gaps

-   This is a perfect example of what we want presented at this
    workshop: a sense of what's going on, before it is finalized. Thank
    you!

-   Q: (Adam) in your first slide you had something about "we looked at
    PPP to understand the relation b/t science and invention. If we
    *knew* which were the pairs: can we use this analysis to get a
    deeper understanding b/t the science and the invention? and predict
    which science linked to which inventions would produce valuable
    inventions?

    A: that's part of the idea, one of my colleagues (Dominique?) should
    join there. that's a longer goal, to get that kind of understanding\
    A: often you might take inspiration from a scientific idea...

-   NB: Lee Fleming is talking about related work tomorrow.

## **Patents Phrase to Phrase Semantic Matching Dataset**

*Grigor Aslanyan*, Google\
Ian Wetherbee, Google

This is a new public phrase-to-phrase dataset for semantic textual
similarity (STS): the *Google Patent Phrase Similarity Dataset*\
- human rated, contextual, focused on technical terms, w/ similarity
scores \
- with granular ratings/flags
~(e.g.\ synonym,\ antonym,\ hypernym,\ hyponym,\ holonym,\ shared\ domain,\ unrelated...)~

Existing STS collections build on Wikipedia, books, &c. not technical
terms.\
Our dataset was used in a Kaggle
[competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching "null")
in March 2022.

We focused on **phrase disambiguation** (adding CPCs for context),
**adversarial keyword** matching, and **hard negatives** (explicit
non-relation)

Dataset features: \>100 CPC classes... (*pull out this slide*)\
\
*Method* \
**Choosing anchors**: \
 - we keep phrases that appear in 100+ patents, \
 - randomly choosing 1000 anchor phrases from these.\
 - randomly sampling up to 4 CPC classes for each, for context\
**Generating targets**: \
 - we randomly select phrases from the full corpus with a partial
keyword match with an anchor,\
 - we use a masked language model, asking BERT to generate replacement
phrases after masking out each instance of the phrase\
**Rating**

#### Questions + Comments {#questions-comments}

--- This is meant to be a tool to fine tune models rather than intended
as a model itself\

## **Mapping Patents to Technology Standards (**[**slides**](https://conference.nber.org/conf_papers/f176406/f176406.slides.pdf "null")**)**

*Fabian Gaessler*, Pompeu Fabra University\
Dietmar Harhoff, Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition\
Lorenz Brachtendorf, Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition

**Summary**: We try a new method to link patents to standards based on
semantic similarity. Useful for SEP litigation, strategic patenting,
contribs to tech progress. \
*Future* *Improvements*: refine similarity measure, extend to other
standards, historical and other regions

**Data sources + challenges**

-   Standards: We focus on ETSI - a standards db with 40k standard docs,
    varying in size \>1k pages, may describe multiple technologies and
    split at a chapter level.

-   Also 18,000 declared SEPs, at family level

-   Challenges: long texts, multiple docs, two - corpora.

**Similarity approaches**

-   `octimine`: closed-source🙁, via Natterer(2016). 'vector space
    model', cosine + other? fine tuning

-   *tf-idf*, embeddings: we checked results with this

*\[Statistical overviews\]*

--- linking essentiality status to predicted essentiality\
"if this worked better I would be out founding a company offering
patent-tech"

we compared this w wifi patents, and hand-marked gold standard, w/
similar results.

![](https://assets.pubpub.org/1wexlxmk/41670077554074.png){#n35ii013che}

We posted everything on Harvard Dataverse: with csv's for 60k docs, use
cases, and more. \
[Semantic similarity of patent-standard
pairs](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/B2RJSX "null")
~(ETSI,\ IEEE,\ ITUT)~

### Discussion

-   Tim --- we are basically citing one another's unpublished papers
    here. great to see this. Can you say more about similarity score
    coeffs and how this changes for claims?

    -   w/ *claims*: Effect size gets smaller. there's a tradeoff b/t
        the noise you have from just having \[claims\] vs \[standards\],
        and bias that may come in (from also looking at description,
        less uniform?) and

    -   also interesting that the final decisions (across the corpus)
        didn't change that much when using just claims or using full.

-   Tim: ideas - take claim + description, find ones that are more
    similar on one or the other. perhaps claims change in ways that make
    them fall w.r.t. standard. There's such time variation in patenting
    and standardization processes, this micr-longitudinal change could
    show which ones move in or away from specs. From a policy
    standpoiint: can you find things that wer close substitutes but
    isn't essential? Policy debate her is that stands process created a
    monopoly that wasn't there before. So: what were the alternatives
    early in stands?

    -   We looked at undeclared-by-humans but high-similarity. overall
        seem less valuable. also much older at the time; patent had
        expired. Share of SSO membership was not lower among these.

-   One way to get essentiality is to put language in your patent into
    the standard (in one direction or the other). Given the slow
    standards process, you have opportunities through continuations +
    more. My concern w/ this approach: it's not that patents are written
    in a eureka moment, and language summarizes that insight!

    -   A: this is complex. there are some just-in-time patenting
        studies, also personal ties: can you see prelim drafts, file a
        patent just before adoption? This is an issue for many such
        efforts.

    -   Adam: sounds like you could document this phenomenon by looking
        at increasing similarity over the course of the standards
        process

## [**The NBER Orange Book Dataset: A User's Guide**](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30628/w30628.pdf "null")

*Maya Durvasula*, Stanford University\
Scott Hemphill, NYU Law School\
Lisa Larrimore Ouellete, Stanford University\
Bhaven Sampat, Columbia University and NBER\
Heidi Williams, Stanford University and NBER

Patents are used as measure of innovation; but *mappings to products*
can be unclear. There's no straightforward linkage. But this is
different in pharma, Via the [Orange
Book](http://rx-wiki.org/index.php?title=Orange_Book "null").

We introduce a newly digitized OA dataset of Orange Book records, w/
annual editions providing snapshots at points in time; giving a
comprehensive portrait of legal protections over drug lifecycles.

**Challenges**:

-   OB records are self-reported, not audited by the FDA. we validated
    against external benchmarks

-   appropriate use may differ across researchers. use case: calculating
    market exclusivity.

"Orange Book" is a misnomer. Real name: Approved Drug Products with
Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, for pharmacists to track
generic-brandname links. Related: *Hatch-Waxman Act* for drug price
competition.

Not everything is eligible for listing. Only patents that could
reasonably be asserted (to track infringement of generics). Incentives
to list all patents: generic competitors have to challenge every patent
that's still in force at the point they enter the market. \[challenge
means: legal certification, required to argue each specific patent is
either invalid or not infringed\]

Any infringement suit leads to 30 months of blocking generic approval.
Free extra exclusivity! Sometimes called 'pseudo-patents'. We see 5
categories of exclusivity:

1.  New chemical entity (NCE): 5y

2.  Orphan drug (ODE): 7y

3.  Pediatric (PED): 6mo

4.  Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN): 5y

5.  180-day exclusivity (Generic DE): 6mo

**Find our dataset** on NBER: the [NBER Orange Book
Dataset](https://www.nber.org/research/data/orange-book-patent-and-exclusivity-data-1985-2016 "null")
([Readme](https://data.nber.org/fda/orange-book/historical/1986-2016/README.pdf "null")).
~\ ~Good news: you can *just use this* w/o worrying about gaps! \
^\[4\ data\ files:\ Drug\ patents,\ patent\ use\ codes,\ \ drug\ exclusivity,\ drug\ exclusivity\ code...\]^

Of 2500 new drugs 1985-2015, 80% have one form of such protection. Of
800 new molecular entities, 96% of these 'innovative drugs' have one.
This exclusivity is granted and recorded directly by FDA.

We run a comparison to IQVIA/Ark, look at litigation records, and at
extended patents under Hatch-Waxman. The majority of drug patents do get
recorded in the Book.

We also looked at 4 predictable changes to expiry.\
1.TRIPS, \
2.PTExtension, \
3.PTAdjustment, \
4.Maint. fee non-payment (at 3.5/7.5/11.5)

At high level all things are accurate, but non-payment doesn't appear!
firms just stop self-reporting. **45% of patents expire before full
term**. Must find other resources to track.

*Context*: this was originally an appendix for another project
estimating market exclusivity: Nominal, Expected, Realized\
(what do legal protections say they confer, what shielding should be
expected, how much time actually elapsed in a case)

### Discussion {#discussion}

-   Dan Gross: could you list some potential misuses as well as good
    uses of this dataset?

    -   Bhaven: positive use cases included... Don't count all entries
        as if they are equal. e.g. those that actually matter for
        generic entry.

-   Errors/disputes

    -   If you're a competitor you can state that a record doesn't
        actually conflict w/ listed drugs. there are 54 active disputes
        here, from generic competitors. This is hard if you're not
        yoruself in the weeds re: what the patent text allows. Our
        period ends in 2015, and there weren't disputes that ended in
        delisting in that period.

    -   Until 2003, you could get multiple 30mo stays. firms would start
        pulling new OB listings out of nowhere. Had to be fixed in the
        Medicare Modernization Act

-   Q: have you thought about how different IP rights complement one
    another?

    -   The project this was originally an appendix for is doing that:
        looking at new uses for approved drugs, and how patent +
        regulatory exclusivity interact. Definitely something you can do
        with this data!

-   Comment: \[from USPTO\] the [**patent examination research
    dataset**](https://www.uspto.gov/ip-policy/economic-research/research-datasets/patent-examination-research-dataset-public-pair "null")
    (**PatEx**)includes patent status, expiry due to non-maintenace.
    Published annually since 2014. Google Patents may have more, if you
    need older years reach out and we can track down where it actually
    is.

-   Comment: renewals can be found in **PatStat**.

## **Progress Report on an Inventor-Author Crosswalk**

*Lee Fleming*, University of California, Berkeley

We have initial results, model, and proposed flow.

\[*Doudna, Langer examples*\]

**The Gatekeepers of Science**: \
Papers for pure sci, Light bulb for pure inventor, Gate for sciinventor.

Relationship width: \# of coauthorships. \
Heterogeneity across lab clusters?

**Artefacts**:

-   Sankey diagram of Doudna's OA ID / PatsView ID shows over-splitting
    in OA.

-   For a ML model estimating missed links:

    -   take subset of Marx/Fuegi patent-article citations that are
        self-citations. look for scientists w/ ORCID IDs \['best thing
        we have right now'\]

    -   Features of prediction model: many! Clean up all fields, plug
        in, publish accuracy estimates.

    -   Enable sub-setting, intermediate results

![](https://assets.pubpub.org/5zbizt39/71670082938702.png){#ntocqal7doq}

some features used in distance calculation

**Challenges**: Queries directly draw from OAlex right now. Encoding
takes time. For clustering, let users choose an algorithm, show both
sanity check + confidence measure.

### Discussion {#discussion}

Lee - Our server died, so we're trying to figure out the economies of
hosting own severs and BigQuery.

-   Say more about this? How could BQ help?

    -   Some IT guys suggested using \[it\] to help keeping this running

    -   NB: for Gaetan, curation feels like the critical upkeep cost

    -   What are the most expensive parts of keeping this updated?

        -   OA updates their dataset every 6mo. PatentsView each year.
            We want to turn the crank. Needs \~10k compute each time...

OA is changing in real time, since last year. Maybe they're trying to
cluster researchers. (A: we should incorporate those)

Q: Are you using OA's `field` concepts? They're a bit wonky, too sparse,
too many of them associated w/ each researcher.\
A: We're using those and rolling our own, trying both. I'm a
pathological case: my patents are in materials science, and I'm a social
scientist now.\
A: (Adam) I waded into this in NZ, looking at the work of NZ scientists
who worked in NA/Europe and returned. typically in db's they are treated
as different people. Different location + institution! May be impossible
to handle

-   Doesn't seem impossible for a human, or a great machine reader (esp
    if they can trace the full timeline of other work of each person)

Q: is there a way to \[use email to prompt to dig deeper\]?\
Q: what fraction of scientists have an ORCID? \
A: as of 2022: about 6M distinct ORCIDs are associated with at least one
work or external identifier. Recency bias.

## **Panel**: **How do we validate patent metrics derived from semantic analysis?**

There has been an explosion of development of semantic-based measures
seeking to capture similarity across patents; novelty; disruptiveness,
value or impact, etc. The panel will bring together researchers who've
been working on these metrics to discuss questions such as: what is the
relationship of these metrics to older ones based on, e.g., patent
classification or citations; how should validation be structured (should
people validate their own measures or should we try to create some kind
of shared or over-arching validation process); what is the relationship
between different modes of validation (e.g. correlation with exiting
metrics, testing against subjective expert judgements, correlation with
outcome indicators such as productivity or prizes)\

\
*Ina Ganguli*, UMass Amherst --- *Using NLP to study innovation*\
Josh Lerner, Harvard + NBER

Approaches to validation:

1.  Internal validity: expert ratings (13 from 5 fields)

2.  External validity: citations, shared family, shared ID

*Ideas*: use new combinations of classes to estimate novelty\
Special case: look at 400 patents that got rare awards. \
Control case: not novel / impactful? (US grant, EPO/JPO rejection).

**General remarks**

-   preprocessing text makes a big difference. \
    articulate tradeoffs b/t simple and advanced approaches. \
    explain why text works better (than trad measures). \
    define the goal (better to estimate what?). \
    we need new benchmarks to validate metrics.

-   To everyone: provide raw data, and the code that processes it! \
    That lets others replicate, vary steps, chain processes.

### [**InnoVAE**](https://tiny.cc/innovae "null") - Generative AI for patent innovation

We looked at different representations for innovation.

--- token-based methods, embedding methods, topic methods are used for
similarity, but there is no regularization of the learned manifolds/
latent spaces, so distances are hard to interpret.

--- semantic orthogonality + dimension independence is not internalized
or sharpened. ---\> problem of unique interpretability

Innovae: develops Innovation Space --- constructing economically
interpretable measures, in a well-disentangled representation.

-   What could you get by combining two patents? E.g., combinational
    creativity for claims. How exceptional is one patent in the context
    of a portfolio / with respect to one tech factor?

-   Desirable features: *Multimodal*, ... (insert slide)

-   Innovation factors, for one topical specialty:

![](https://assets.pubpub.org/mz0dj0a0/11670086908344.png){#nl9o12q7mh4}

-   Our ideal: A common dataset, task, metric + benchmarks

    -   compare how speech + language models evolved; Kaggle today

    -   unite scattered approaches to this for patent/scholarly data

-   Downstream application: predict [*Tobin's
    q*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobin%27s_q "null")*.*

### Discussion {#discussion}

-   Cautious optimism about advancing the s.quo with language models

-   Is there a way to look inside black boxes to describe what's driving
    the process (and compare options)?

-   Limits of language similarity: (Andy Toole) Applicants have an
    incentive to morph language to differentiate their applications and
    help overcome objections related to novelty and nonobviousness. Now
    Bronwyn is talking about strategic language

-   (Adam) One concrete thing that seems to be coming out of this: \
    **We should create a parallel index of validation datasets**\
    Get everyone \[running contests\] to compare a) their prize
    matching\[?\],  b) standard tests to run new measures against. Then
    referees could say "you have to run your new metric against those
    testing datasets"

-   Josh's comments hinted at this: \
    Patents are issued through a resource-intensive admin process.
    There's just a lot of eyes on these docs. As we saw today there's a
    lot of emphasis on similarity, but we haven't targeted what Julian
    was talking about : examination process, assignment to examiners, to
    a unit, what kinds of rejection specific claims get.

    -   That's more informed than a lot of RAs who look at patents

    -   That plugs into a community of commercial/professional services
        \[tools to get your patent assined to a favorable art unit\]

    -   If we do things relevant to that community they could come help?

-   Validation tasks seem specific to an application... but for human
    coding, we could draw standards from how to design the coding task.\
    People are expensive, if consistent over time... and a recent
    emerging patent pool is "Open RAN" for 5g. They decided there was so
    much IP clamoring to get in, they had to turn it over to computers
    to dtermine essentiality.

    -   \[machine reading / synthesis is good enough to get lots of
        leverage here\]

    -   (Adam) we could explore this more systematically.

    -   the first AI winter came about due to a lack of shared
        validation?

    -   compare how [Papers With
        Code](https://paperswithcode.com/ "null")/[Papers With
        Data](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets "null") work now

-   More clarity would be useful for specific common ideas:

    -   *Similarity* (much more than just cosine of feature vectors)\
        ex: consider what we're looking at similarity *between*

    -   *Quality* (Bronwyn has a whole chapter on this)

    -   *Novelty* (compare to what, on what timescale)

-   General Q: Is public pair data available? \
    A: it is discontinued; queries go through [Patent
    Center](https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/ "null")
