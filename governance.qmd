# Innovation Information Initiative (i3) Governance Document

**Version 1.0 | Effective Date: [Insert Date]**

## 1. Mission and Purpose

The Innovation Information Initiative (i3) is a global community of economists and innovation scholars dedicated to building open, interoperable datasets to advance research on science, technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship. i3 develops high-quality public datasets, shares methodological best practices, and coordinates research infrastructure to democratize access to innovation research data.

## 2. Organizational Structure

### 2.1 Steering Committee

The Steering Committee is the primary governing body of i3, responsible for setting strategic direction and making major organizational decisions. It comprises five to seven members serving staggered three-year terms, providing continuity while enabling the regular introduction of new perspectives. Decisions are made by simple majority vote of members present at a duly constituted meeting. The Steering Committee approves annual budgets, expenditures above $5,000, changes to governance policies, and the admission of new Steering Committee members.


**Decision-Making:**
- Decisions require a simple majority vote
- Quorum: At least 50% of committee members must be present
- Meetings held at least semiannually

### 2.2  Lead(s)

The Project Lead manages day-to-day operations, maintains technical infrastructure, and serves as the primary point of contact for i3. The Project Lead is authorized to approve expenditures under $5,000 without prior Steering Committee approval and is responsible for preparing agendas for Steering Committee meetings, maintaining records of decisions, and reporting regularly to the Steering Committee on operational matters.


### 2.3 Project Groups

Topic-specific project groups may be established by the Steering Committee or community members to focus on particular datasets, methodologies, or infrastructure needs.

Project Groups are topic-specific teams open to all i3 community members. They carry out the substantive research and data-development work of i3, including dataset construction, methodological documentation, and community education. Any community member may propose a new Project Group; formation requires approval by the Project Lead or the Steering Committee. Project Groups operate with significant autonomy but report periodically to the Steering Committee and the broader community on their activities and outputs.

## 3. Membership

### 3.1 Community Members

i3 membership is open to researchers, students, and practitioners actively engaged in innovation research. Members are expected to participate constructively in the community, which may include contributing to Project Groups, attending community meetings, and proposing new initiatives. There are no formal membership dues; i3 relies on the voluntary contributions of time and expertise from its members, as well as financial support from donations, grants, and institutional partners.

### 3.2 Steering Committee Selection

New members are nominated by existing Steering Committee members or the broader i3 community and confirmed by a majority vote of the Steering Committee. There are no formal term limits, though the Steering Committee encourages periodic renewal of membership to bring in new voices. Members wishing to step down should provide reasonable notice to allow for an orderly transition.

## 4. Financial Management

The Steering Committee is responsible for the financial health of i3. It approves annual budgets and any individual expenditure above $5,000. The Project Lead has authority to approve expenditures below this threshold in the ordinary course of operations. i3's funding sources include donations from individual researchers and institutions, grants from foundations and government agencies, and other forms of institutional support.

To support long-term financial sustainability, i3 is exploring fiscal sponsorship through [numFocus](https://numfocus.org/), a nonprofit that provides financial and administrative infrastructure for open-source scientific projects. Under this arrangement, individuals and institutions would be able to make tax-deductible donations to support i3's infrastructure and dataset maintenance. An annual financial report will be made publicly available on the i3 website.


## 5. Decision-Making Processes

i3 follows a tiered decision-making model designed to balance efficiency with accountability. Routine operational matters — including expenditures under $5,000, day-to-day project management, and community communications — are handled by the Project Lead. Major decisions, including budget approval, governance changes, new Steering Committee members, and significant strategic shifts, require a majority vote of the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee aims to hold regular meetings (at least twice per year) and to conduct business by email or video conference as needed between meetings.

## 6. Code of Conduct

### 6.1 Principles

i3 is committed to fostering an inclusive, respectful, and collaborative community. All members must:
- Treat others with respect and professionalism

### 6.2 Violations

Reports of Code of Conduct violations should be submitted to [designated contact]. The Steering Committee will investigate and determine appropriate actions, which may include warnings, temporary suspension, or removal from the community.

## 7. Intellectual Property and Licensing

### 7.2 Attribution

## 8. Amendments

This governance document may be amended by:
- Two-thirds vote of the Steering Committee
- Community consultation period (minimum 30 days)

## 9. Dissolution

In the event of dissolution:
- All remaining funds will be transferred another organization supporting open science
- All datasets and tools will remain publicly available
- Documentation will be archived in long-term repositories

## 10. Effective Date and Review
