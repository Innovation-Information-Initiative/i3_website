#### Database, Methodological Tools, and Research Opportunities: Creative Destruction Lab and Early-Stage Technology Ventures

**Presenters:** Amir Sariri (Purdue University), Avi Goldfarb (University of Toronto, NBER)

The Creative Destruction Lab maintains a relational database containing 200 linked datasets. Key features include a meeting notes table with granularly linked participant statements, enabling comment-level data extraction.

**Database Features:**
- Data dictionary available for reference
- Comprehensive documentation of early-stage technology ventures

**Discussion Points:**

Mentor recruitment initially occurred through founder networks. The presenter noted this represents "the first entrepreneurship dataset ever," acknowledging a 2013 Crunchbase dataset exists but with limited precedent.

**Data Cautions:** Application data for non-admitted participants exists but lacks follow-up information, requiring careful interpretation.

#### New Products

**Presenters:** Abhiroop Mukherjee (HKUST), Bruno Pellegrino (Columbia University), Alminas Zaldokas (NUS), Yiman Ren (University of Michigan), Tomas Thornquist (Shell Street Labs)

**Research Focus:** Analyzing consumer surplus changes and firm effects when successful products launch, recognizing GDP growth limitations in capturing welfare impacts.

**Methodology - Three Components:**
1. Building new product introduction database
2. Estimating firm profits from introductions
3. Measuring spillovers and consumer surplus

**Key Finding:** The team uses announcement dates as unambiguous reference points, observing clear discontinuities. Longer observation windows reveal larger effects, accounting for market anticipation.

**Discussion Highlights:**

The researchers employ event studies analyzing firm-level responses without computing individual cross-firm comparisons, avoiding millions of imprecise studies. They calculate spillover effects using closed-form solutions.

Regarding unpriced knowledge spillovers, the presenter acknowledged limitations: "knowledge spillovers may be there, we're not looking at those." Patent-specific spillovers may manifest differently than product-related ones, and the model cannot capture non-price information effects by construction.

On interpretation, the team accounts for oligopolistic equilibrium pricing adjustments across all market participants.

**Return Measurement:** Unlike patent studies using distributional assumptions for negative returns, this project benefits from sharp announcement dates providing superior signal-to-noise ratios for capturing expected value signals.

#### Novelpy: A Python Package to Measure Novelty and Disruptiveness

**Presenters:** Pierre Pelletier, Kevin Wirtz (University of Strasbourg)

This open-source tool quantifies novelty and disruptiveness in scientific work, supporting peer recognition and influencing science/technology policy.

**Disruptiveness Measurement:** The package examines citation networks using six distinct disruptiveness indicators, each with documented critics. Users receive all indicators for evaluation.

**Related Work:** Previous research on cognitive diversity and its impact on novelty and citation impact analyzed PubMed publications. Reference: "Sails and Anchors, 2023"

**GitHub Repository:** Available at indicated link

**Discussion:**

The tool functions with OpenAlex data after preprocessing steps, making it adaptable to various datasets beyond PubMed's abstracts and MeSH terms.

Regarding data quality issues—excessive self-citations, duplicate references, quirks in source data—the current approach requires minimum three references for inclusion but doesn't systematically flag edge cases for manual review.

## Saturday, December 7

### 9:00 am - Building Datasets with LLMs

#### LLM-based Topic Modeling

**Presenters:** Victor Lyonnet (University of Michigan), Amin Shams, Shaojun Zhang (The Ohio State University)

**Dataset:** 6,800 expert consultation calls from 1,700+ companies analyzed for topic-specific sentiment and deal outcome prediction signals.

**LLM Application:** GPT-4 via University of Michigan Azure account enabled processing of complex transcripts with intricate structure. Topic-level sentiment analysis proves difficult for traditional methods like LDA.

**Important Caveat:** Prompt wording selection easily biases results.

**Topic Generation Process:**
- Generate topics from 20% sample
- Cluster and standardize results
- Assign standardized topics to full transcript corpus

**Sector Variation:** Topic focus varies significantly by industry; beverages/drinks sectors emphasize competitive market discussion.

**Predictive Analysis:** Most topics show minimal predictive power for outcomes, but specific topics—positive technology discussion and positive customer signals—demonstrate strong predictive validity.

**Discussion:**

When working with ChatGPT-style LLMs on larger texts like three-hour transcripts, text length affects problem frequency. Specificity of prompt construction determines whether fine-grained paragraph or page-level feature extraction becomes problematic.

#### A Robust Green Patent Database

**Presenters:** Yuan Sun (Shanghai University of Finance and Economics), Xuan Tian, Yuanchen Yang (Tsinghua University)

**Identification Approach:** Leveraged CPC and EPO labels for sustainable technology patents, reviewing 580K labeled patents associated with green innovations.

**Dataset Expansion:** Identified CPC classes previously underrepresented in green patent catalogs, expanding beyond EPO's Y02 classification.

**LLM Classification:** GPT 4o-mini assessed patents for green designation, revealing 19% of Y02 patents assessed with low confidence and 13% additional green patents outside Y02 classification.

**Training Dataset Development:**
- Hand-compiled training data from initial assessments
- Applied 2:1 negative-to-positive example ratio
- Generated detailed patent descriptions using GPT 4o-latest

**Cost Optimization:** Validated each process step across different models to identify most efficient options reducing expenses. Designed all processes for mobile device compatibility.

**Availability:** Open-source code available at yuanresearch/Robust-Green-Patents-Paper; requires personal API token.

**Discussion:**

Cross-framework comparison represents next steps, though initial validation involved only 100 samples. Database aspires toward worldwide green innovation coverage; transportation patents provided starting point.

Model robustness across years should improve with refinement, though validation methodology requires clarification regarding consistency across calendar years versus CPC application changes.

CPC code selection sensitivity requires examination. Nuanced environmental impacts—traffic efficiency potentially increasing driving demand—challenge LLM evaluation capabilities regarding ambiguous sustainability connections.

#### Distilling Data from Large Language Models

**Presenters:** Maya Durvasula, Sabri Eyuboglu, David Micha. Ritzwoller (Stanford University)

**Objective:** Collect and organize public pharmaceutical clinical trial design and outcome information.

**Data Sources:** clinicaltrials.gov and PubMed present integration challenges:
- 3,000+ sponsors lack complete trial result publication
- Proprietary databases use public databases as input sources
- Distinguishing reporting updates from interpretation differences proves difficult

**Technical Achievement:** Comparable performance to advanced ChatGPT using transparent, reproducible open-source models at 3% cost.

**Performance Metrics:** Custom model surpassed seven traditional regressions on both true and false positive rate measures, particularly excelling at false positive reduction.

**Important Context:** Seven clinical trial tags exist; many studies use only one, providing multiple data organization approaches and interpretation possibilities.

**Model Construction - Custom Task-Specific LM:**

1. Hand-labeled 3,000 examples
2. Generated multiple prompt variations
3. Requested noisy label generation from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4
4. Fine-tuned open-source model selections

**Large-Corpus Labeling:** Commercial model-generated labels enabled labeling substantially larger corpora than manually feasible, identifying more clinical trials than some existing sources suggest, contradicting hypothesized declining participation rates.

**Discussion:**

Publication bias acknowledgment: Denominators of unpublished studies remain large. Dataset construction excluded reanalysis across multiple publications. Trends examined don't indicate publication bias shifting over the study timeframe.

Reporting guideline implications warrant policy consideration. Two regulatory strands emerged: post-2007 registration requirements and post-2017 result reporting mandates for FDA-regulated sponsors. FDA enforcement remains unenforced through financial penalties. The FDAAA Trials Tracker documents potential penalty collection from non-compliance.

**User Request Fulfillment:** NCT Number inclusion in the GitHub repository data extraction can occur if successfully extracted.

### 10:45 am - Comparative NLP Methods

#### Tracing the Flow of Knowledge From Science to Technology

**Presenters:** Dietmar Harhoff, Michael E. Rose, Mainak Ghosh, Sebastian Erhardt, Erik Buunk (Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition)

**Historical Context:** Early models like BERT lacked comprehensive horse-related terminology, causing systematic omissions in relevant patent and research identification.

**Model Development:**
- Pat-SPECTER: Fine-tuned SPECTER on patents
- Pub-SPECTER: Fine-tuned SPECTER on publications via Semantic Scholar

**Validation Approach:** Created "racing ground" comparing models using 1,000 randomly-selected patents with 5 cited publications and 25 non-cited publications ranked by similarity.

**Performance:** SPECTER and Pat-SPECTER performed comparatively well on ranking tasks.

**Applications:**
- Patent-paper pair separation from citations
- Patent-paper pair prediction
- Prior art search for earlier publications

**Resources:**
- logic-mill.net platform demonstration
- HuggingFace repository: mpi-inno-comp/pat_specter

**Discussion:**

GROBID historically facilitated this type of data extraction. LLMs now offer potential improvements, though English abstracts remain necessary. Springer articles, lacking shared abstracts, present extraction difficulties. Logic-mill's next generation will incorporate Scopus abstracts.

#### Patent Text and Long-Run Innovation Dynamics

**Presenters:** Ina Ganguli (UMass Amherst, NBER), Jeffrey Lin, Vitaly Meursault (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia), Nicholas F. Reynolds (University of Essex)

**Research Question:** Track "evolution of similarity" across two centuries comparing identical conceptual similarity measures across different text assignment models.

**Models Compared:** GTE versus TF-IDF approaches examining long-term trends.

**Validation Strategy:** Rather than selecting single models, employ validation tasks using gold-standard reference points.

**Three Validation Tasks:**
1. Patent Interference (primary focus)
2. Human validation (economists should conduct more)
3. Classification

**Performance Findings:** PaECTER, GTE, and S-BERT excel at different specific tasks. Pre-BERT models lack competitive performance but offer greater interpretability. Using validation tasks as meta-model approach clearly outperforms single-model selection, though specific models demonstrate variable performance across tasks, potentially leading to divergent conclusions.

### 11:45 am - Global Patent Data

#### A New Database of Indian Patents

**Presenters:** Nishant Chadha (Indian School of Business), Satyaki Chakravarty (Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore), Piyasha Majumdar (India Development Foundation)

**Dataset Creation:** Compiled patent-location database using inventor records with postal codes for 85% of entries.

**Data Visualization Features:**
- Process status pages tracking application progress
- County-level mapping capability

**Patent Distribution:**
- Regional distribution maps by postal region
- Sectoral distribution analyses

**Discussion:**

Challenges include blocked author IPs from government interference and computational resource limitations.

**Patent Renewal:** Patents require yearly renewal—a low-cost bureaucratic process. Not all patents undergo renewal; renewal dynamics receive less academic study in India than United States contexts.

**Existing Database Gaps:** Absence from PatStat complicates analysis due to missing patent family relationships. Priority data exists but limited availability (only 60%) in samples. Original office numbers contain thousands of variations requiring extensive cleaning for priority information recovery.

**Pharmaceutical Research Implications:** TRIPS implementation may alter patenting strategies through jurisdiction-specific eligibility distinctions, particularly relevant for chemistry and biology markets where India permits earlier drug patenting than certain jurisdictions.

**Data Linking Potential:** Clinical trial database linkages with Indian drug approval processes remain unexplored; external expertise needed for identification and matching.

#### Creating the China Patent Dataset

**Presenters:** Josh Lerner (Harvard, NBER), Namrata Narain (Harvard), Dimitris Papanikolaou (Northwestern, NBER), Amit Seru (Stanford, NBER)

**Purpose:** Track Chinese patenting growth and innovation implications.

**Illustrative Example:** Hypersonic missile development—years of elevated patenting preceded military developments perceived as surprising, demonstrating patent data's predictive signal value.

**Dataset Scope:** 16 million patents after cleaning and deduplication from multiple sources.

**Included Elements:**
- Translated assignee names
- Technology tags
- Non-cite patent quality measures

**Current Status:** Database launch anticipated next year pending data refinement prior to public release.

**Research Objectives:**
- Resolve critical technology classification links
- Track relative US-China industry positioning over time
- Identify patents eligible for cross-jurisdictional filing

**Discussion:**

**Patent Classification:** The database distinguishes between invention patents and utility model patents. Simplified analysis focuses on China's top-class patents, excluding second-tier utility patents due to definitional complexity.

**Cross-Border Filing:** US filing propensity analysis is underway, with preliminary examination within critical technology contexts. Economic theory predicts best patents receive greater cross-border filing, with caveats regarding secrecy in certain cases.

**Validation Against Commercial Databases:** Early Patsnap comparison efforts revealed concerns:
- Desired fully public, open, unencumbered database without licensing restrictions
- Many commercial tools primarily derive information from public sources

**Recent Economic Shifts:** Foreign investment decline post-2021 influences analysis scope. VC community observations indicate environment migration from US-mirroring systems to government-dependent funding with conditions attached.

**2018 Changes:** Specific funding environment shifts when many US funders departed appear traceable in patent data.

**Policy Interest:** TIER (Technology Import and Export Administration Regulations) enabling Chinese technology capture warrants study regarding impact on innovation patterns.

#### A Novel Dataset for Historical Innovation Studies: Linking USPTO Patents and US Census Data from 1850 to 1940

**Presenters:** Zenne Hellinga (Utrecht University), Jay Praka. Nagar (Duke University), Stefano Breschi (Bocconi University), Andrea Morrison (University of Pavia), Gianluca Tarasconi (IPQuants)

**Status:** Work in progress; authors welcome feedback on public release.

**Research Gap:** Recent historical patent studies lack inventor background information—families, occupation, birthplace—despite increased interest in long-term trends.

**Existing Efforts:** Previous inventor-census linkages vary substantially in matching strategy, coverage, and granularity.

**Project Goal:** Create publicly available linked dataset with maximum coverage, comparing methodologies against existing datasets.

**Data Sources:**
- Google Patents
- US Census (cross-decade linkage)

**Methodology:** Dividing and organizing data according to inventor and census period specifications.
